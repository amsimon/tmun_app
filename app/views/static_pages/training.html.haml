      Our trainings are public and topics vary on a weekly basis.  The overall purpose of our training meetings
      is to build on an individual’s public speaking abilities while at the same time improving their awareness
      of international affairs.  In order to achieve this, we run simulations that emulate those within the United
      Nations.  We teach delegates how to debate within the context of the United Nations and how to write
      effective public policy.  We also like to ask “what if?” and run fantasy simulations from time to time.
      We occasionally take a break from simulations to play games aimed at improving public speaking skills.

          Study contemporary issues of international significance and discuss them within the context of the
          United Nation’s subcommittees.
        %li
          More fully understand the interconnectedness of our world and apply our knowledge by competing in
          conferences and discuss issues of international significance from the perspective of another nation.
        %li
          Instill in each member a sense of responsibility towards maintaining international peace and well-being
          through cooperation.

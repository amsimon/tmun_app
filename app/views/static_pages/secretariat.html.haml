    -#      Model United Nations has offered me the opportunity to apply my education into something that I am truly passionate
    -#      about.  When I travel and compete, I am given the unique opportunity to step into the shoes of an individual who
    -#      has completely divergent views from my own and practice the art of speaking in a diplomatic manner.  As a chair,
    -#      I can design a committee around a topic that interests me and I can listen to the positions of younger students who
    -#      have worked hard and researched their country's policy.  As the President of Model United Nations at UCSD, I am
    -#      fortunate to work with such a skillful team with a passion for what they do.  Whenever I'm not doing something
    -#      with MUN, I am lounging around at the beach, playing video games, or traveling to new places.

    -#      As Vice President I am mainly in charge of helping the President, keeping track of minutes during Secretariat
    -#      meetings, and doing odd jobs for the club.  I am also required to be ready to fill the role of President
    -#      should the need arise.  A little bit about myself, I am a third year political science major, specializing
    -#      in political theory and policy analysis.  My passion for MUN began in high school, where I helped keep my
    -#      high school MUN club afloat.  At the collegiate level, it has been my pleasure to attend a number of conferences
    -#      on behalf of UC San Diego, and to have chaired several committees at the annual spring and fall conferences.
    -#      I am passionate about expanding the club, and making it more competitive.  Besides this, I am an associated
    -#      with the UN Human Rights Council by my connection to the NGO, Humanitarian Lawyers and, International
    -#      Educational Development.  I enjoy debating  foreign affairs, and global issues.  I am also a fanatical reader
    -#      of fantasy literature, and a  lover of old and archaic card games.

    -#      I love dealing with numbers and as Chief of Staff, I make sure the club
    -#      applies for the appropriate funding.
    -#      I also help by organizing and operating fundraisers. I make sure that the
    -#      funds are used for travel and for conferences, as needed. I am currently a
    -#      fourth year, finishing minors in Chinese Studies and Business. After I
    -#      graduate, I hope to work in the finance industry whether it be in
    -#      stocks/bonds or banking. In my free time, I volunteer at the local animal
    -#      shelter, teach swim lessons to all ages and nap. I also love to read
    -#      Economist articles and watch the TV series Big Bang Theory.

    -#      distributed. In my free time, I work at the Veterans Medical Research Foundation studying the usage of
    -#      Electronic Medical Records. I also love camping, skiing, hiking and visiting national parks with my family.

    -#      cause. Some of my hobbies include reading and dancing. I also enjoy traveling to new places and learning
